# The Snakemake-Profiles project

The Snakemake-profiles project is a joint effort to create profiles for executing Snakemake in various computing environments (cluster systems like Slurm, SGE, Grid middleware, cloud computing). Snakemake-profiles has just started, and we need your help to support more computing environments.
